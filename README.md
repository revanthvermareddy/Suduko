# Suduko
This project is aimed at solving the suduko puzzle 
by applying the things I learned from data structures.

# Algorithm Used
Backtracking - where we take a decision at a point in the
problem solving and eventually proceed until we find the
solution. And whenever we encounter an error, we just go
back to the previous time line where we had earlier taken
a decision and try other ways around.

# Learnigs
The algorithm is simple to understand but its a bit tricky
to logically apply in problem solving
